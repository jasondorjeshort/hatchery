# Handoff

Coordinator state. Subagents follow their brief, not this file.
Updated: 2026-10-31 by main session

## Now

- `cac01fd` (status line omits 5h when only 7d is live) and a 7d hold of 97 (owner) are pushed in
  Hatchery and four siblings from side clones in a temp dir. Regenesis: its privacy scan refused the
  push (no `privacy.identities`; ADR 0020 not taken); the owner pushes it. Sibling checkouts need a pull.
- ADR 0020 and 0021 pushed (`4da83b7`); Dystopo base at `f7f41af`. 0021's T-a to T-g not started.
- Filed today by a regenesis session, untriaged, T-b's to take
  (`2026-10-21-git-guard-uses-the-policy-of-the-repo-it-runs-in.md`): the guard applies the session
  project's policy to a `git -C <sibling>` command (why every Hatchery commit and push from the Dystopo
  session was refused); the push rule ignores the remote; the pusher may not `pull --rebase --autostash`.
- Leftovers for a chore: worktrees `../hatchery-wt/T120`, `T121` (merged, branches local),
  `usage-gate` (prunable), `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` (untracked).

## Next

1. The ADR 0021 wave, from a Hatchery-rooted session, in order T-a to T-g (the proposal's
   Recommendation lists each task's files); fold today's guard gaps and the 2026-10-19 guard idea into
   T-b. Agents commit and push the wave's branches; `main` stays the coordinator's until T-a holds.
2. Triage `docs/ideas/` (`triage` skill): the two untriaged guard ideas; the ADR 0012 scan.
3. T-g's migration row for Dystopo (`usage.mode: "block"`, `carry-back/*` in the push branches, the
   rulesets step, the deny lines) runs in Dystopo's session as its second base update, after T-a to T-f.
4. Each sibling in its own session, regenesis and droplet-management too: ADR 0018 back
   (`0018-privacy-scan.md` 9); its 0016 migration; then 0020 and 0021. Then the architect answers
   the critic reviews of proposals 0003 and 0005; critic review of ADR 0006 as a whole.

## Waiting on user

- Decided 2026-10-21: every pushed commit carries the owner's real identity, listed in each
  repository's `policy.json`; trailers allowed (ADR 0020). ADR 0013 stays `proposed`, not re-asked.
- `2026-10-16-scheduled-architect-design-pass.md`: yes or no; the HOLD deny's pool sentences
  (ADR 0011) unseen; delete `~/.claude/usage-state.json` once all projects run the new scripts.
