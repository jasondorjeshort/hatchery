# Hatchery

## Use it with Claude Code

Three prompts, each self-contained. Every one needs Node (hooks and status line) and the GitHub
CLI `gh` (pushing) on `PATH`, and stops at the first failed precondition instead of improvising.

**Start a new project from Hatchery.** Run step one in a shell, then paste step two into the
Claude Code session it opens.

Step one: clone and start Claude Code inside the clone, so the session loads Hatchery's agents,
skills, and hooks. `<project>` must not exist yet, or be empty, and the project's GitHub repository
must already exist and be empty (no README or license initialised, or the first push is refused).

```
git clone https://github.com/jasondorjeshort/hatchery.git <project>
cd <project>
claude
```

Step two: replace `<new project remote URL>`, then paste:

```
Create a new project from the Hatchery base. Preconditions, stop and tell me if one fails: `node
--version` and `gh --version` work; `git status --porcelain` is empty; `git remote -v` shows
`origin` pointing at the Hatchery repository; the `decant` skill is listed. Rename the remote
`origin` to `hatchery`, add `origin` pointing at <new project remote URL>, and confirm both with
`git remote -v`. Load the `decant` skill and follow it to the end: replace the README, write
CLAUDE.md from the skill's template (the agreement imports), set .claude/hooks/policy.json (ask me about thresholds), reset docs/HANDOFF.md and
docs/ideas/, clear docs/findings/, docs/reference/ and docs/design/decisions/ to their READMEs
(Hatchery's records stay in docs/hatchery/), delete the proposals (my own ADRs start at 0001), and commit through the runner.
Do not push. Report the remotes, the files you changed, the policy choices, and the first design step.
```

**Update a project that came from Hatchery** (decanted, or adopted with the third prompt). Paste
into Claude Code inside that project:

```
Update this project from the Hatchery base. Preconditions, stop and tell me which failed if one
does: the file .claude/skills/update-from-hatchery/SKILL.md exists here (if not, this project
never came from Hatchery: stop and tell me to use the "Adopt the Hatchery practice" prompt from
the Hatchery README); `git status --porcelain` is empty; I am on this project's working branch.
Then load the `update-from-hatchery` skill and follow it: add the remote `hatchery`
(https://github.com/jasondorjeshort/hatchery.git) if missing, fetch it, read the skill from the
fetched commit `<sha>` (`git show <sha>:.claude/skills/update-from-hatchery/SKILL.md`, after
`S=$(git rev-parse hatchery/main)`), and apply the patch it describes over the base-owned set,
in the Bash tool. Resolve conflicts by the skill's rule: the base wins unless the departure
table in this project's provenance ADR has a row for the path; the project's own files are
never in the patch. Leave no conflict markers. Re-run the project's checks and tests. Do not
push. Report what changed in the base, how each conflict was resolved, and what I should act on.
```

**Adopt the Hatchery practice in an existing project** that was never decanted from it. The
project keeps its history; the practice arrives as files. Paste into Claude Code inside a private
clone of that project:

```
Adopt the Hatchery practice in this project. It has its own history and must keep it: no merge,
no rebase, no history rewrite. Preconditions, stop and tell me which failed if one does: `node
--version` and `gh --version` work; `git status --porcelain` is empty; I am on this project's
working branch (whatever its name); this clone is mine alone, not a shared working tree; there is
no .claude/agents/ directory here (if there is, use the update prompt instead). Then run
`git remote add hatchery https://github.com/jasondorjeshort/hatchery.git` (skip if present) and
`git fetch hatchery`, read the procedure with `S=$(git rev-parse hatchery/main)` then
`git show $S:.claude/skills/adopt-hatchery/SKILL.md`, and follow it to the end: copy
.claude/agents, skills, hooks, statusline, and rules from hatchery/main; merge Hatchery's hook
entries and permissions into my .claude/settings.json keeping every hook I already have; write
my CLAUDE.md from the template with the agreement imports, my compatible rules under Project
rules, and ask me, with both texts quoted, about every rule of mine that contradicts an agreement
section (each kept one becomes a replacement file and a departure row); add the docs skeleton only
where I lack a file and add rows to my docs/README.md without moving anything; ask me before
adding a LICENSE; list my docs over 300 lines and ask split, exempt or mark (`[length: <reason>]`); write the adopt-hatchery
ADR with the Hatchery base commit; commit from this session. Do not push. Report what was copied,
merged, added, and decided, and tell me to restart Claude Code.
```

## What this is

A base repository for agent-driven, design-first software projects. New projects are decanted
from it: they inherit the conditioning (the working agreement, the agents, the skills, the hooks)
and grow their own design and code. Existing projects adopt the same practice as files. It contains
no application code. What it does contain:

- `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/agreement/`: the working agreement Claude Code follows in the repo
  (`CLAUDE.md` imports the ten agreement files, where the rules live). Agents do all coding and
  debugging, every feature ships with an agent-usable debug interface, major choices go through a
  proposal, a critic, and an ADR, and work stops when plan usage gets high.
- `.claude/agents/`: six subagents with models matched to their job (architect and critic on
  Fable, coder on Opus, tester and pusher on Sonnet, runner on Haiku).
- `.claude/skills/`: the procedures (proposal, ADR, handoff, debug interface, finding, commit,
  brief, decant, update-from-hatchery, adopt-hatchery, carry-back, triage), loaded on demand.
- `.claude/hooks/` and `.claude/statusline.js`: a status line showing the 5-hour and weekly plan
  meters, a gate that refuses new subagents at 50%, a guard against destructive git, and a
  post-edit check on documentation conventions.
- `.claude/rules/docs.md`: conventions that load only when files under `docs/` are touched.
- `docs/`: `HANDOFF.md` (where work stands, imported into every session), `ideas/` (one dated file
  per idea), the design skeleton with proposals and ADRs, `reference/` for durable facts, `findings/` for
  investigation results. `docs/README.md` is the map.
- `LICENSE` and `LICENSES/`: GPL-3.0-or-later by default, LGPL-3.0-or-later text for linkable components.

Layout and reasoning: [`docs/hatchery/decisions/0002-repository-layout.md`](docs/hatchery/decisions/0002-repository-layout.md).

## Starting a new project by hand

The shell block in the first prompt's step one is the by-hand start: clone, `cd`, `claude`. The
step-two prompt does the rest (remotes, then the `decant` skill). By hand from there: rename
`origin` to `hatchery`, add the project's `origin`, then run `/decant` in Claude Code and follow
the `decant` skill. On GitHub, mark this repository as a template (Settings, "Template
repository") if you prefer a clean history; a template copy has no shared history, so treat it as
an adoption (third prompt), not a decant.

## Pulling base improvements into a project

The second prompt above does this for either kind of project, by one procedure (ADR 0016). By
hand: `git fetch hatchery`, then in the Bash tool run the command that
`node .claude/hooks/ownership.js --command --ref <sha>` prints (`<sha>` is `git rev-parse
hatchery/main`; it patches only the base-owned set, never a file the project wrote), and bump the
base line in your provenance ADR. Resolve conflicts by the rule in
`.claude/skills/update-from-hatchery/SKILL.md`: the base wins unless the departure table in your
provenance ADR has a row for the path; the project's own files are never in the patch.

## Adopting the practice in an existing project

The third prompt does this. It copies the practice from `hatchery/main` and records the commit it
came from in an ADR in your project; your history, README, docs layout, and existing hooks stay.
Decisions a model must not make alone (a license, a rule of yours that contradicts one of
Hatchery's) are put to you with both texts. Reasoning and the exact list of what is copied, merged,
or added only where absent: [`docs/hatchery/decisions/0004-adopt-hatchery.md`](docs/hatchery/decisions/0004-adopt-hatchery.md).
